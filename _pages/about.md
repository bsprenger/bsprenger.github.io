Hi! I'm bsprenger, a software engineer and robotics enthusiast passionate about reinforcement learning, simulation environments, and building cool things with code.

I'm interested in exploring the intersection of robotics, machine learning, and software engineering. This site is where I share my projects, experiments, and learnings in these areas.

## Interests

- **Robotics & Simulation**: Working with simulation environments and robotics frameworks
- **Reinforcement Learning**: Exploring RL algorithms and their applications
- **Machine Learning**: Imitation learning, policy learning, and practical ML implementations
- **Software Engineering**: Building robust, well-designed systems

## Recent Work

I'm currently exploring integration of custom environments with machine learning frameworks like Hugging Face's LeRobot, and experimenting with various simulation platforms including PyBullet and Gymnasium.

Check out my [blog posts](/year-archive/) to learn more about my projects and experiments!
