I'm a robotics software engineer with a focus on:
- Reinforcement learning 🧠
- Control systems 🎯
- Physics simulation 💻

I build **autonomous robotics** systems that **actually touch the real world**.

- 🤖 Current: **controls software engineer** @ [Kodiak AI](https://kodiak.ai/), where I'm working on **autonomous vehicles** 🚚
- ✨ Side interests: [spaced repetition systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaced_repetition), reading [James Joyce](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Joyce), and looking at [Lucian Freud](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucian_Freud) paintings

This site is where I share my projects, experiments, and learnings.
